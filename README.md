<!--
Pratik is a Product Developer currently working on Open source Project building "cx" A new programming language for blockchain using Go Programming Language.

CX is a general purpose, interpreted and compiled programming language, with a very strict type system and a syntax similar to Go Programming Language. CX provides a new programming paradigm based on the concept of affordances, where the user can ask the programming language at runtime what can be done with a CX object (functions, expressions, packages, etc.), and interactively or automatically choose one of the affordances to be applied. This paradigm has the main objective of providing an additional security layer for decentralized, blockchain-based applications, but can also be used for general purpose programming
